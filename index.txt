Help Your ELLs Gain Priority Literacy Skills

When English language learners move beyond the language barrier, the need shifts from basic survival skills for communication to a literacy knowledge focus. Targeting key ELL areas such as vocabulary, oral language, and reading and listening comprehension is a priority to move them toward grade level.

LANGUAGE! Live® is a comprehensive literacy solution for grades 5–12 offering direct, explicit, and scaffolded instruction ELLs need to develop oral language and word reading proficiency while strategically increasing reading and listening comprehension skills.
